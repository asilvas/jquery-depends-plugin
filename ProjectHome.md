**Update Sep 17th 2010** - While no new updates in several months, don't think the project was abandoned, it was not, just hasn't been much need for new functionality or fixes. If you come up with something new, or needs fixed, let me know!

The idea behind jQuery Depends plugin is to provide a very feature rich way to handle any and all forms of dynamic resource usage and consumption, or in other words, a javascript-based dependency resource loader. Beyond the typical forms of loaders that exist for stuff like images or data, this plugin also handles the inclusion and execution of style sheets (.css) and scripts (.js) files. Tons of great features and flexibilities to manage your applications resources how you see fit, all with minimal effort using this very light weight plugin.

This is a very new plugin I plan on using for some big projects in the near future, and while I do expect great things to come, do keep in mind it is not production tested yet!

Lastly, feel free to contribute your time (bug reports, feature recommendations, FAQ's, code, etc).

Enjoy!
